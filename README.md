## 🚀 **Installation**  
> Get your portal up and running in a few simple steps!

1. **Install Python**  
   Make sure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your system.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and change the directory to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the command below to install all necessary libraries as outlined in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command will automatically set up **Django** and all other essential dependencies.

## 🛠️ **Additional Configuration**  
> **Tailor the portal** to your specific environment and needs.

### ⚙️ Database Setup  
By default, the portal is tailored to work seamlessly with **PostgreSQL**. Make sure your local PostgreSQL server is running, with a database (e.g., `"EventDB"`) and proper user credentials configured in your project settings. If preferred, you can switch to **MySQL** by updating the `settings.py` file accordingly.

### 🖼 Static & Media Files  
Organize your static assets—images, event banners, logos—in the designated directories as defined in your Django settings. Adjust file paths as necessary to suit your project structure.

### 🔧 Customization & Extendability  
This platform is highly adaptable! Future enhancements might include:
- **Event notifications**  
- **Multi-user role capabilities** (admin, participant, guest)  
- **Interactive user feedback systems**  

Your creative journey to further customize this experience is only limited by your imagination.

### 🏠 Environment Isolation  
For an optimal and conflict-free setup, it is recommended to use a **virtual environment**. This practice isolates your project’s dependencies from other Python projects, ensuring a clean and maintainable workspace.
